## AWS 
See below for links to the references to see what my Toplogy is and what my subnets (CIDR) looks like.  

* Login to your AWS console  
  Browse to https://\<Account Id:\>.signin.aws.amazon.com/console  
  NOTE:  I usually do my demo work in us-east-1 (N. Virgina)  
* Create 2 x VPCs   
  Click Services and in text box "Find a service..." type "VPC" and select VPC

* Create 4 subnets in each VPC (2 x public, 2 x private)
* Create and Attach IGW to each VPC
* Create Route Tables and associate with Public Subnets
